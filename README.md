middleman-aws
=============

Simple set of [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) rake tasks to build and deploy to AWS using s3_sync and cloudfront invalidation.

# Installation and Configuration

### Step 1: Add this gem to the Gemfile

    gem 'middleman-aws'

    # Even though already required by the middleman-aws gem, it appears middleman does not
    #   pick up transitive dependency extensions early enough  to avoid the
    #   "== Unknown Extension:" error.  Add these to your main project
    #   (I wish this was unnecessary but don't know how to work around it)
    gem 'middleman-s3_sync'
    gem 'middleman-cloudfront'

### Step 2: Require this gem in the Rakefile

    require 'middleman-aws'


### Step 3: AWS credentials

#### Option 1 - secrets file
e.g. `~/.aws/acme.yml`

This should contain the access and secret keys generated from the selected IAM user.  This is the only file that will need to reside outside the repository.  `acme` is equivalent to the directory name for your project.
Don't worry, validation will make sure you have the path right.

```ruby
access_key_id: XXXXXX
secret_access_key: XXXXXX
```

#### Option 2 - ENV variables
If you don't create secrets file, then environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` will be used. 

#### Option 3 - IAM
If a secrets file is not present (option 1), there are no ENV variables (option 2), then request to AWS will fail (unless middleman-aws is used on EC2 instance with correct IAM role, then AWS will take care of authorising requests).

### Step 4: Add the necessary s3_sync and Cloudfront sections to your config
This is a sample of how a common config is setup with variables extracted:

```ruby
# Configuration variables specific to each project
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWS_BUCKET                      = 'acme.alienfast.com'
AWS_CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID  = 'xxxxxx'

# Variables: Sent in on CLI by rake task via ENV
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWS_ACCESS_KEY                  = ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY']
AWS_SECRET                      = ENV['AWS_SECRET']

# https://github.com/fredjean/middleman-s3_sync
activate :s3_sync do |s3_sync|
  s3_sync.bucket                     = AWS_BUCKET # The name of the S3 bucket you are targeting. This is globally unique.
  s3_sync.aws_access_key_id          = AWS_ACCESS_KEY
  s3_sync.aws_secret_access_key      = AWS_SECRET
  s3_sync.delete                     = false # We delete stray files by default.
end

# https://github.com/andrusha/middleman-cloudfront
activate :cloudfront do |cf|
  cf.access_key_id                    = AWS_ACCESS_KEY
  cf.secret_access_key                = AWS_SECRET
  cf.distribution_id                  = AWS_CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID
  # cf.filter = /\.html$/i
end
```

# Usage
Run the desired rake task.  It's as simple as `rake mm:publish` in one step, or you can choose to do things one step at a time.
See the available rake tasks below or run `rake -T`

# Available Rake Tasks

    rake mm:build        # Compile all files in the build directory
    rake mm:clobber      # Remove all files in the build direcory
    rake mm:deploy       # Deploy to S3 and invalidate Cloudfront after a Git commit/push
    rake mm:preview      # Run the preview server at http://localhost:4567
    rake mm:publish      # One step clobber, build, deploy
    rake mm:show_config  # Show config

# Real World Sample
